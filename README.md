# NetX
NetX is a simple to use Linux tool that I've written in C++ with the libcrafter library (library created by Pellegre). It's not a security programm, it's a little hacking programm that I coded just for fun.
It allows you to scan a network, detect the connected devices on the network and sniff a specific connection (for example the http port can be sniffed and its packets can be intercepted and readed).
It aslo allows to kill a simple connection device/gateway or kill all connections on the network.

My programm can have some bugs and imperfections, that is why I publish the source code if you want improve it or add new features.
If you have any questions, contact me.
